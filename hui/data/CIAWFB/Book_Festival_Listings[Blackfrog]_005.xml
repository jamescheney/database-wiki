		<event_info>Acclaimed author Sharon Dogar has 'her own particular brand of probing, looming, sensual inquiry' (The Guardian). Now, she turns her insight to a world-famous story: the Diary of Anne Frank. Discover her poignant and challenging new novel exploring life in the annexe, and the struggles in coming of age in a time of terror, all told from the point of view of Anne's first love, Peter.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Anywhere but here, that's all we asked. We specially commissioned world-class writers to tell a story about somewhere that isn't their home. It could be Mars or purgatory or the land of the Fey. It could be Hong Kong or Falkirk. David Almond and Elizabeth Laird discuss the process of delving into the alien territory of Elsewhere and share their remarkable insights.</event_info>

		<event_info>No Edinburgh International Book Festival seems complete without an appearance from one of this country's beloved literary sons. The North Queensferry-based scribe has twenty four books to his name since bursting vividly onto the scene with the bleakly comic The Wasp Factory and has switched fruitfully between mainstream literary novels and highly acclaimed sci-fi works. Come and hear one of our wittiest and most outspoken authors.</event_info>

		<event_info>'On a horse, you have an intelligent animal doing all of the work and most of the thinking, leaving you free to look and listen,' says Robin Hanbury-Tenison about his passion for exploring on horseback. Now he has applied that philosophy to a journey across Albania, one of the 'most beguiling and least known' corners of Europe, and emerges with a triumphant documentary record.</event_info>

'No book has had greater influence on the English language', wrote one commentator. True or false? The surprising answer is: both.</event_info>

		<event_info>In the 19th century, Scottish caricaturist George Cruikshank achieved international fame with his humorous cartoons. Since then, comic artists have satirised and lampooned the politicians of their day. Cedar Lewisohn, contributor to a major new book on the subject, takes a look at Britain through the eyes of its cartoonists.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Is it better to live as a vociferous public agent, or to be content with a quiet, self-fulfilled family life? Jim Crace's new novel All That Follows takes readers to the year 2024 and an encounter between 'sofa socialist' Leonard Lessing and an old acquaintance Maxie Lermontov, whom he hasn't seen since 2006. Lermontov has taken a group of people hostage at gunpoint in their own home, just a short drive from Lessing's house. What should Leonard do?</event_info>

		<event_info>After scooping the Booker Prize in 2005 for The Sea, John Banville took four years before publishing the follow-up. The wait was worth it for fans of the Irish author as he brought us The Infinities, a twenty-four-hour tale of a rural pile owned by the Godley family, a brood ravaged by suicide, self-harming and miscarriage. A painful mix of appearances by Greek gods completes this heady literary cocktail.</event_info>

		<event_info>The celebrated psychologist Oliver James showed in his book Affluenza that as our wealth increases, we tend to feel less happy. Alex Preston, having worked as a trader in the City of London, was inspired by James's book to write his first book - a 'credit crunch novel' named This Bleeding City.

The sixth of Kerr's novels starring Gunther, it delves more deeply than ever into the geology of Berlin, and emerges with a story that sees Kerr moving into top gear.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>The collapse of the Berlin Wall was one of the major anniversaries celebrated in the last year and two books take different paths to that monumental moment. Norman Stone's The Atlantic and Its Enemies kicks off in 1946 and leads us intelligently through the Cold War while Peter Millar pens a personal memoir of his years on the frontline with 1989: The Berlin Wall - My Part in its Downfall.</event_info>

		<event_info>This Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist spent many years reporting from the world's brutal war zones, but nothing could prepare him for the grief he felt when his mother died suddenly. McAllester decided to revisit the recipes his mother had cooked for her family before being snatched by illness. Haunting, gripping and deeply moving, McAllester's book is a love story of the first order.</event_info>

		<event_info>Urgent, funny and often deeply moving, Booker Prize-winner Roddy Doyle has won the hearts of millions of readers. In his new novel, The Dead Republic, Doyle returns to his unruly hero Henry Smart to chart a portrait of Ireland in the 20th century. Henry finds himself an unlikely Hollywood hero before returning to Ireland in 1951 where he is caught in a bomb blast and is hailed as a hero of a very different kind. Doyle discusses his new novel and his new short story commissioned by the Book Festival for our Elsewhere project.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar.

		<event_info>Away from the mainstream of pop, independent music has quietly flourished over the past three decades, and two recent books document very different facets of the sounds that defined Generation X. Neil Taylor's history of Rough Trade records includes interviews with founder Geoff Travis, Jarvis Cocker and the late John Peel, while Garth Cartwright takes an American road trip in search of cowboy poets, country troubadours and down-and-out bluesmen.</event_info>

		<event_info>Few nature writers capture the glory of the natural world on our doorsteps as succinctly as Sir John Lister-Kaye. Since he transformed a Victorian hunting lodge in Inverness-shire into a field studies centre, Lister-Kaye has walked through its surrounding landscape almost every day. At the Water's Edge is a meditative account of the sights, smells, details and hidden histories he observes on his regular walk to a small hill loch.</event_info>

		<event_info>'I embarked on the journey rather hesitantly,' says Michael Frayn about his memoir of early childhood, 'but as the story began to tell itself, I found myself being carried along by it to places I had never foreseen.' Frayn's fascinating and often moving account of his childhood in suburban Surrey and of his father, an asbestos salesman, forms the subject matter for this afternoon's event.</event_info>

		<event_info>Explosive, mordant, rambunctious and hilarious: Howard Jacobson's prose style generates plenty of colourful adjectives from the critics, and he is commonly described as one of Britain's greatest - but bafflingly undervalued - living writers. Jacobson's new book, The Finkler Question, an unflinching story of friendship, wisdom and loss, should finally win him the recognition his talent deserves.</event_info>

		<event_info>Adam Smith may have seen himself more as a philosopher but it's his ideas about commerce which have become tenets of modern economics. In Adam Smith: An Intellectual Biography, historian Nicholas Phillipson explains just how much Smith's ideas helped formulate the different intellectual and commercial cultures of both Glasgow and Edinburgh during the Enlightenment, and how closely he worked with David Hume to develop his theories.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Raja Shehadeh is one of the leading chroniclers of Palestinian life today. We are proud to launch his latest book, A Rift In Time, which tells the story of a great uncle who dedicated his life to the freedom of the Palestinian people during the Ottoman Empire. Shehadeh discovers that much of the history of Palestinian people is buried deep underground - both literally and metaphorically.</event_info>

		<event_info>With the help of three professional actors, Lanark author Alasdair Gray presents the short prologue and the first act of his irreverent adaptation of Goethe's Faust into a comedy called Fleck. Not satisfied with Goethe's own ending, Gray says he 'wanted to wrench the story into my own vision of the 20th and 21st century'. He does so by inviting the Devil to lead the hero into a 21st century that Goethe never imagined.</event_info>

		<event_info>Once described as a 'novelist in the great English tradition of moral seriousness', Salley Vickers has released a new novel which mixes that seriousness with a deft lightness of touch. Dancing Backwards is the story of Violet Hetherington, who takes a transatlantic cruise to New York to visit an old friend, only to find that the journey evokes some traumatic memories. But then she meets Dino, whose lessons in ballroom dancing help Violet begin an inner journey of recovery.</event_info>

		<event_info>In The Siege, the Orange Prize-winning author Helen Dunmore wrote about Hitler's devastating assault on Leningrad from 1941 until 1944. Dunmore's latest book, The Betrayal, picks up the lives of the same characters, charting their trajectory into a post-war life of Soviet-era paranoia. Against this backdrop, the idealistic doctor Andrei is faced with the task of amputating the leg a of secret police boss's cancer-suffering son. A stunning depiction of human love, hope and suffering.</event_info>

		<event_info>Are you Hearts or Hibs? Gay or straight? Scottish or British? Whether born into them or a member by choice, identity groups have a major impact on the way we live. Guardian columnist Gary Younge's book, Who We Are, covers everything from the personal views of Tiger Woods to the truth behind the Danish cartoons controversy, and gives a devastating analysis of the way society works.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Shades of Grey depicts a world after a catastrophe known as 'the Something that Happened', in which people now see on widely differing chromatic scales. Here, the colours you can see dictate your status and hero Eddie Russett is doing fine, until he falls in love with a Grey - someone of the lowest social standing. Fforde's comic blend of Douglas Adams and Monty Python will guarantee him many new fans.</event_info>

		<event_info>Back in the 18th century, when the men and women of the British Raj needed a cool drink on the verandah, special ales were developed in Britain for export to the lucrative Indian market. Light in colour, and more bitter than the brown ales popular at home, these India Pale Ales achieved legendary popularity. Pete Brown, one of Britain's best-loved beer experts, tells the fascinating story of IPA.</event_info>

		<event_info>Have previous analyses of Pictish society distorted and denied the real history of Scotland? This is the starting point for writer, musician, folklorist and poet Stuart McHardy in his potentially explosive A New History of the Picts. The Romans, Angles and Vikings all failed in their efforts to conquer the Picts who, McHardy contends, were the descendants of the original inhabitants of these lands and went on to help create modern Scotland.</event_info>

		<event_info>He's the UK's number one bestselling crime author and a perennial favourite of audiences at the Book Festival: this year, as Ian Rankin celebrates his 50th birthday, he is very much at the top of his game. We welcome the Diamond Dagger-winning author back to discuss his police procedural thriller The Complaints and to explain why, with or without Inspector Rebus, Edinburgh offers the perfect backdrop for his stories.</event_info>

		<event_info>Intrepid Dutch journalist Linda Polman has spent over twenty years reporting from war zones including Rwanda, Afghanistan, Sudan and Iraq, and she has been forced to draw some bleak conclusions about the efficacy of Western aid. In a searingly honest and often hilarious book, War Games, she quotes one rebel soldier who says: 'W.A.R. means Waste All Resources. Destroy everything. Then you people will come and fix it.'</event_info>

		<event_info>We are pleased to introduce a writer whose first book is an instant classic. In The Running Sky, Tim Dee looks up and sees not simply birds, but a wheeling rush of fluid energy. Storm petrel song is 'an inward and sibylline sound of swazzle notes and speaking stones', while starlings 'chime and merge, like iron filings made to bend to a magnet'. An emotional response to nature, Dee's book is unforgettable.</event_info>

		<event_info>'Soldiers who can write are as rare as writers who can strip down a machine gun in forty seconds, but Patrick Hennessey is one,' said the Sunday Times. Hennessey was posted to Iraq in 2006 and Afghanistan in 2007, where he became the youngest Captain in the army. His memoir is the lucid testimony of a surprisingly well-read soldier, spelling out the futility of his outdated training at Sandhurst and the boredom of 21st century warfare.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Small Island, Andrea Levy's last novel was voted the 'best of the best' novels ever to win the Orange Prize, and her new book The Long Song is so good it may even surpass that achievement. It tells the story of an exuberant, ebullient woman, July, and her life on a Jamaican plantation in the years before the abolition of slavery. Levy discusses how she created this captivating and truly unforgettable fictional voice. Chaired by Charlotte Higgins.</event_info>

		<event_info>When he inherited a collection of tiny Japanese ivory carvings from his great-uncle, Edmund de Waal did not realise that these exquisite objects would provide the key to a very unusual family history. Originally collected in Vienna, the carvings were smuggled out, one by one, in a chambermaid's pocket when Hitler's forces approached. De Waal's account, The Hare with Amber Eyes, is a highly original memoir and a ripping yarn.</event_info>

		<event_info>The Booker-shortlisted writer Michael Collins hits top form again with Midnight in a Perfect Life. A once successful novelist, Karl, is about to leave his thirties and is worried about his literary legacy. His breadwinning wife, Lori, is more concerned with starting a family before it's too late. But this forces Karl to confront his darkest fear: will he turn out like his own father, a travelling salesman who was found dead with a murder accusation hanging over his head?</event_info>

		<event_info>A renowned screenwriter as well as an author, William Nicholson shot to fame for co-writing films such as Gladiator. His latest novel, All the Hopeful Lovers, explores seven days in the life of a family in which a fifty year old woman discovers her husband is having an affair, while her teenage children are caught in a parallel web of desire. With characteristic empathy, Nicholson's perceptive studies of relationships highlight a very recognisable fear that we might make a mess of the ones that matter to us most.</event_info>

		<event_info>The Edinburgh Makar (Poet Laureate) Ron Butlin is widely acclaimed both for his poetry and his novels, while his wife, Swiss writer Regi Claire, has twice been shortlisted for a Saltire Scottish Book of the Year award. Together they weave an entertaining hour of poetry and prose, which puts Scotland into a truly international context.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>The astonishing His Dark Materials trilogy won Philip Pullman the Whitbread Book of the Year and the Carnegie Medal. Now, Pullman has re-imagined the story of Christianity in The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ. In this keynote event he discusses his ideas with Richard Harries, formerly Bishop of Oxford and Dean of King's College London. It is certain to be one of the talking points of the 2010 Book Festival. Introduced by Richard Holloway.</event_info>

		<event_info>Two years ago Catherine O'Flynn burst onto the British literary scene with What Was Lost, a debut that won the Costa First Novel award and became a bestseller. Now she returns with a much-anticipated follow-up, The News Where You Are. The story of a TV presenter in Birmingham haunted by mysterious disappearances, this book is tender, uplifting and very moving. Chaired by Francis Bickmore.</event_info>

		<event_info>In difficult times, there are few voices more balanced than that of Adam Phillips, the psychoanalyst and honorary visiting professor of English at York University, whose recent books include elegant meditations on kissing, sanity and kindness. Fitting, then, that Phillips's much-anticipated new title should look at the subject of balance itself. Phillips's ideas are a delightful rejoinder to a world enduring a lasting hangover from an era of excess.</event_info>

History and continents are crossed as the stories of Plato, Zaynab and narrator Dara reach a climax.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>February, by the Commonwealth Prize-winning Canadian author Lisa Moore, is a beautiful novel based on a real life event: the sinking of the Ocean Ranger oil rig off Newfoundland in 1982. Moore charts its effect on the life of a woman whose husband is killed in the disaster, a tragedy which still exerts a powerful emotional pull years later. She discusses her work with fellow Canadian author Marina Endicott, whose second novel, Good to a Fault, explores virtue and tolerance. That virtue is tested to its limit after a car crash.</event_info>

		<event_info>In his first book, John Holloway presented his ideas for a world without capitalism. Now Holloway, a respected academic working in Mexico, goes one step further with Crack Capitalism, which seeks to reopen the debate among those looking to put in place an alternative economic system. He discusses his ideas with David Smith, whose new book explores the reasons why the credit crunch took so many people by surprise.</event_info>

		<event_info>The 20th century was the bloodiest in history, and in Central Europe the pain was most keenly felt. After a brief, joyful period of Modernism, the region endured the horror of Nazism and then the stagnation of Soviet-era communism. Against that backdrop, writers such as Czeslaw Milosz and György Faludy provided a vital literary perspective, and now their work is being reissued in the Penguin Central European Classics series. In this event, leading contemporary writers reflect on the significance of this brilliant work for today's post-communist context.</event_info>

The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained.

We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire.

		<event_info>Action-packed tales from Darren Shan, the master of ghoulish demons and vampires. The hero in his new title The Thin Executioner embarks on a dangerous journey which few have survived. But no quest seems too brutal when important matters of honour (and a certain girl's heart) are at stake. Darren might even give us a sneak preview of his forthcoming series - seize the chance to say 'I knew it first'.</event_info>

		<event_info>Summer is about to get very exciting with the launch of Young Sherlock Holmes. What was the greatest-detective-in-the-world-ever like as a teenager? Well... he was busy uncovering his first murder and dealing with his eccentric family. Author Andrew Lane leads a not-so-elementary event full of mystery.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire.

		<event_info>Carnegie Medal winner Theresa Breslin presents her unique mix of historic intrigue and romance on the wrong side of the tracks. Learn about life during the Spanish Inquisition and how the two main characters - Zarita and Saulo - make Prisoner of the Inquisition one hell of a read. Theresa will bring along the exciting stuff that inspires her writing - great artefacts collected during her travels.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Lord of the Flies meets Heroes in Gone, a fantasy vision of what would happen if everyone over the age of sixteen disappeared overnight. Super-writer Michael Grant riffs off everything from Battle Royale to Wikipedia in his much-hyped series and will take you on a thrilling ride. He flies in especially from the US to launch the next instalment - blink and you'll miss it.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Illustrator Sarah McIntyre is master of the Pickle Rye world, the home patch of Lettuce the rabbit and Vern the sheep. Her artwork oozes silliness and humour; no wonder she's one of the original Fleece Station artists, a collective whose grand title derives from their love of drawing... sheep! Her work featured in the Guardian and is now published by DFC - bring your own pen and a lot of gusto for the launch of this new title.</event_info>

		<event_info>Award-winning author Sally Gardner shares her charming stories for younger readers. The title characters of The Boy With the Lightning Feet and The Strongest Girl in the World are just two of the delightful heroes who parade through her classic collection of extraordinary adventures. A treat for the whole family.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>This award-winning double act is back after the 2009 sell-out run, with more fascinating facts about our relatives' lives during the Second World War. Mick Manning and Brita Granström's picture books reveal the exciting and personal stories of those who helped with the war effort - from Mick's dad's secret missions in the RAF to his mum's James Bond-like stint with the team who cracked the German enigma code.</event_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event.

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire.

		<event_info>Get ready for an event where the story literally jumps off the page onto the stage! Chris Bradford, author of the Young Samurai series, brings his own samurai sword to Edinburgh and demonstrates some of his martial arts techniques (Chris has trained in karate, kickboxing, samurai swordsmanship and ninja secret fighting). Hear about young samurai Jack and what happens when some mean-spirited fighters get dirty.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere.

		<event_info>In two powerful new books Philip Golub and Oscar Guardiola-Rivera argue that the United States is moving towards a radical new political order - and much more rapidly than we may think. Golub shows how the US is heading for a crisis of its own making in which it is no longer able to set the global agenda, while Guardiola-Rivera claims that it is quickly transforming into a Latin American country.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Where the Serpent Lives is the debut novel by the prize-winning British poet Ruth Padel, taking readers on a journey from London to the deep Indian jungle to discover the place of wild nature in human lives. Padel discusses the challenges of moving from poetry to prose, and the joys of her search for where the wild things are, in conversation with Iain Valentine, Director of Animals, Education and Conservation at Edinburgh Zoo.</event_info>

		<event_info>Born in Calcutta and educated in Oxford, Neel Mukherjee's personal experiences have parallels with those of the main character Ritwik in his debut novel A Life Apart. Mukherjee contrasts Ritwik's life as an outsider in Oxford with passages from a novel that Ritwik is attempting to write, in which a young English lady is an outsider in 1900s Bengal. But Ritwik's own life takes an altogether darker turn.</event_info>

		<event_info>Growing up in Bradford in the 1970s, Zaiba Malik lived just round the corner from Shehzad Tanweer, a man who went on to detonate a bomb on a London train in 2005. Both were torn between two identities: 'British' and 'Muslim'. Published on the 5th anniversary of the 7/7 London bombings, this award-winning journalist's memoir offers a unique perspective on how young British Muslims became disaffected and radicalised.</event_info>

		<event_info>If there's a constellation of British writers who will define the shape of literature in the next thirty years, then David Mitchell is its brightest star. The inventive structure of his Booker-nominated Cloud Atlas prompted comparisons with Italo Calvino and Paul Auster, while his new book, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, is set on a post-colonial Japanese island. We are delighted to welcome an author who is moving into top gear.</event_info>

		<event_info>There are scarcely enough superlatives to describe the career of Norman Foster. His world-renowned designs include the new Wembley Stadium, Beijing Airport, the British Museum's Great Court, and one of the towers at Ground Zero in Manhattan. Deyan Sudjic, director of the Design Museum, has written the story of a man who built a practice with 1,000 employees, but which has never compromised on quality. In this event Lord Foster talks to Sudjic about his singular life and work.</event_info>

You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event.

		<event_info>The huge influence of Joyce Carol Oates on American literature comes not only from the fact that she writes so many books that are so very good. As a teacher at Princeton University she has also tutored several of the best younger American writers. In this event Oates discusses her two books published in 2010, both of which, in very different ways, involve young people coming to terms with their own sexuality.</event_info>

Written by Nicolai Lilin, Siberian Education is a snapshot of a group of families from the Russian criminal underworld who were deported to Transnistria in central Europe, where they continued their violent activities.

		<event_info>He designed the Danish Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo 2010, and a city in Azerbaijan in the shape of seven mountains: Bjarke Ingels and his practice BIG are rising stars of European architecture with a reputation for cheekily shaking the foundations of the building industry. Perhaps most fearless of all is BIG's approach to publishing its work. While others produce stylish volumes of restrained photography, BIG has published a playful cartoon manifesto entitled Yes Is More. In this event he describes the ideas behind his practice's astonishing work.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events.

		<event_info>Stories have arcs and purpose. Some say computer games are the exact opposite of that: anti-Story Machines. But this year's PS3 game Heavy Rain is hailed as the first game with a real immersive story: is the terrain changing? In this event led by author and scriptwriter Charlie Fletcher, conflicting views come face to face: developmental experts meet gamers and neuroscientists to discuss whether games are kryptonite to Story or great unrealised opportunities.</event_info>

In this final event of the day, Fletcher brings together all the day's participants for a debate about the power of Story, and how we can put our storytelling powers to better use.</event_info>

Stuart Sim claims that the world's need for technologically-driven economic progress could destroy the planet, while Matt Ridley counters that humankind is so innovative and flexible that the 21st century will be a period of increased prosperity and biodiversity.

		<event_info>Brian Keenan spent more than four years as a hostage in Beirut at the end of the 1980s where he forged a deep friendship with another hostage, John McCarthy. But before this traumatic episode, Keenan grew up in Belfast - a place very different from the modern Irish city of today. In this remarkable and moving memoir Keenan returns to his childhood, providing a powerful evocation of Northern Ireland in the 1950s.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Previously a winner of the Orange New Writing Prize for her book Disobedience, Naomi Alderman, with her new book The Lessons, has taken on the challenge of revisiting Evelyn Waugh's 1945 classic about ambition, forbidden love and betrayal. Alderman's novel tells the story of James Stieff and his Oxford undergraduate friends, whose lives are joined - and ultimately warped - by the presence of a wildly erratic but fabulously wealthy friend, Mark Winters.</event_info>

However, all over the world there are people who have been imprisoned for writing critically about the government or the country where they live.

		<event_info>The BBC's World Affairs Editor ranks among the great political journalists of his generation. Even so, John Simpson is adamant that a news story is not the 'truth', but a version of events. He joins us to discuss the ways in which the reporting of important 20th century events has been manipulated by the British press, and how major political decisions have been influenced by the power of newspaper proprietors.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Translated from the Dutch bestseller and accompanied by a film, Bride Flight is Marieke van der Pol's story based on real historical events. It follows three brides-to-be who are among twenty six women taking a flight from London to Christchurch in 1953 to meet their fiancés, on what becomes known as 'the bride flight'. But on the aeroplane the women meet a beguiling bachelor named Frank, who is set to change the trajectory of their lives.</event_info>

		<event_info>Miss Thing is the debut novel (or 'anti-novel', perhaps) by Dundee-based American writer Nora Chassler, and it tells the story of a teenage girl embarking on a modelling career, and her relationship with a struggling thirty-something author. Meanwhile, the acclaimed poet R J Price has written The Island, which tells the story of a man who thinks the world is about to end. Toby Litt described it as 'one of the most beautiful nightmares you'll ever have.'</event_info>

		<event_info>In 1938, Pearl Buck was the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, for her 'epic descriptions of peasant life in China'. Yet, as Hilary Spurling argues in her biography Burying the Bones, Buck is now virtually forgotten: 'She has no place in feminist mythology, and her novels have been eliminated from the American literary map.' Spurling's biography reaffirms Buck's status as a literary superstar.</event_info>

		<event_info>The stand-up comic and broadcaster taps into our modern fascination with genealogy for My Family and Other Strangers, in which he takes a wry trip through the Hardy ancestry. The trigger for this investigation was his grandmother, who made wild claims that the family had a famous architect and a royal bodyguard hanging around on the Hardy tree. What follows is a funny memoir and an absurdist jaunt from Croydon to Malta.</event_info>

		<event_info>The Guardian's art critic is well known for his trenchant views on artists living today, but in his new book The Lost Battles he takes us back to 1504, when Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci battled for a painting commission in Florence. That moment, Jones argues, marked the beginning of the High Renaissance, and the birth of modern cultural life. Jones discusses his ideas with the director of the Scottish National Galleries, John Leighton.</event_info>

		<event_info>Two of the men who collaborated on editing The Letters of Samuel Beckett join us to discuss one of the true heavyweight literary figures of the last century. This first of four volumes covers the period of 1929 to 1940, where we get a real sense of the Irish dramatist's emerging voice set against the backdrop of massive and sustained upheaval in Western Europe.</event_info>

		<event_info>Writers are safest in countries that value free speech. However, all over the world there are people who have been imprisoned for writing critically about the government or the country where they live. Each day we pay tribute to persecuted writers from different countries. Today we consider writing from and about China - ancient culture, global economic power and one-party state.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Having lived there for six years as the Guardian's China correspondent, Jonathan Watts has gained an incredible insight into the country's culture, history and people. In his book When a Billion Chinese Jump, Watts shows that China sits on the edge of an environmental disaster which will affect the entire world. Watts laces his polemic with the stories of individuals across the country, showing that even with the threat of a crisis so severe every single person can make a difference.</event_info>

		<event_info>What is it like to be gay and a neo-fascist? Max Schaefer explores this in his debut novel Children of the Sun, using real press cuttings from the period to follow the story of Nicky Crane, a hero of the British Movement in the 1980s. By contrast, Anthony Cartwright looks at British-Asian tensions between football fans, in the run-up to a big match in the Midlands town of Dudley.</event_info>

		<event_info>We are honoured to welcome two poets whose contributions to the country's written heritage rank highly among South Africa's recent cultural achievements. Keorapetse 'Willie' Kgositsile, one of the first ANC members to leave the country in order to fight apartheid from elsewhere, is now South Africa's poet laureate and his work ranges from the overtly political to the highly personal.

		<event_info>While 9/11 and the death of Diana continue to exercise the mind of the casual conspiracy theorist, literary fantasists harbour the sensational notion that the plays of William Shakespeare were penned by someone else. Samuel Johnson Prize-winner James Shapiro is having none of it. In Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?, he puts forward the case for 'our immortal bard' being the author of Macbeth and co while demolishing the supposed candidates one by one.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>With Family Britain, historian David Kynaston continues his series of books which follow the story of the UK from VE Day up to the election of Thatcher as Tory leader in 1975. With post-war hardships easing, the 1950s became a time to let it hang out a bit more. For Kynaston, this was the period of Roy of the Rovers, Hancock's Half Hour and teddy boys.</event_info>

		<event_info>D-boys and D-girls are what Hollywood calls the Development Executives whose job it is to work with writers and producers to get a story camera-ready. Because they've all read the identical how-to books by screenwriting gurus, everything looks a little more samey as each year goes by. Scriptwriter and author Charlie Fletcher brings together a panel of filmmakers and critics to show that when movies are just defective cookie-cutter copies, they are the real dangerous Story Machines.</event_info>

		<event_info>The man behind such grand TV epics as Shooting the Past and Capturing Mary recently returned to the world of films with Glorious 39. As Europe teeters on the verge of war, the feisty Anne Keyes attempts to foil a pro-appeasement plot. Stephen Poliakoff drops in to a city and festival he loves to talk about the published screenplay and about making the film.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>In The Arabs and the Holocaust, prominent Middle East-watcher Gilbert Achcar discusses how events in the Second World War have helped shape various Arab worldviews. The Punishment of Gaza comes from Gideon Levy, a journalist dubbed a 'thorn in Israel's flank', who explores the long, intricate planning behind the Gaza assault and how its painful legacy will affect the region forever.</event_info>

		<event_info>Almost two decades after his seminal rock tome, The Dark Stuff, iconic NME journo Nick Kent has produced his very personal memoir of the 1970s. It was an era when he became close buddies with Iggy Pop, dated Chrissie Hynde and even lived out the dream of being a temporary Sex Pistol. Apathy for the Devil is a story of inspiration, glory and the ultimate burnout.</event_info>

		<event_info>Following David Greig's Herald Angel-winning adaptation of Raja Shehadeh's When the Bulbul Stopped Singing in 1994, the acclaimed Scottish playwright has adapted another part of the Palestinian chronicler's memoirs to produce An Imagined Sarha. First staged in Glasgow earlier in 2010, this production is directed by Cora Bissett and we are thrilled to revive it in Edinburgh. The fifteen minute performance is followed by a discussion between Shehadeh and Greig.</event_info>

		<event_info>One is a celebrated and much-loved New Zealand novelist, brought up among a family of strong women after her father departed; the other is a woman drawn inexorably towards public life because she was born into Pakistan's most powerful political dynasty in its history. Despite their widely different backgrounds, both Fay Weldon and Fatima Bhutto share the way in which a parent's loss affected their understanding of the world. Chaired by Ruth Padel.</event_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Writers are safest in countries that value free speech. However, all over the world people are imprisoned for writing critically about the government or the country where they live. Each day at the Book Festival, we pay tribute to persecuted writers from different countries. Today we hear from writers who champion their communities by defending their environment. Among those reading: Anil Ananthaswamy.</event_info>

		<event_info>Having tackled personal demons in his memoir All of These People, the BBC's war reporter returns to the battlefields of history with Road of Bones: The Siege of Kohima 1944. Outnumbered, British and Indian troops went up against the brutal might of the Imperial Japanese Army. The pitiless horror of war is given the typically humane Fergal Keane treatment. In conversation with Antonia Swinson, whose father, Arthur Swinson, fought in the battle of Kohima.</event_info>

		<event_info>The author of The Amnesia Clinic taps into an upbringing in Brazil with new novel Heliopolis. Ludo, a twenty seven year old employee of a 'communications company', was plucked out of his São Paulo shantytown as a child and transported into a world of luxury. But while most would have been relieved to escape abject poverty, Ludo carries his past like a badge, leading him to the brink of disaster.</event_info>

		<event_info>Although he died in 1973, the influence of Neil M Gunn on Scottish literature has continued to grow. Although he was perhaps best known for novels such as The Silver Darlings and Butcher's Broom, Gunn was also passionately political and was particularly interested in nationalism, internationalism and the Scottish Literary Renaissance. This year Dairmid Gunn, his nephew, has collated some of Gunn's finest essays under the title of Belief in Ourselves and we are thrilled that he will join us to discuss his uncle's ideas.</event_info>

		<event_info>The simplistic debate of nature versus nurture may be discredited, yet it is now commonly assumed that intelligence is more driven by genetics than by the environment. David Shenk argues that while genetics plays some part in intellectual aptitude, it is in fact our environment that makes the biggest difference. If he's right, Shenk's ideas have profound implications for education and social policy.</event_info>

In Linden MacIntyre's The Bishop's Man, Father Duncan MacAskill aka The Exorcist, has to dig deep within himself after years of covering up the terrible deeds committed by some priests. Jim Powell's The Breaking of Eggs is set soon after the Berlin Wall has fallen and features a Polish émigré tracing the mother who selflessly saved him from the Nazis in an act he previously believed to be one of betrayal.</event_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event.

		<event_info>Each year, thousands of people around the world are murdered by a member of their own family for the apparently exalted ideal of 'honour'. Rana Husseini, a respected journalist, has devoted much of her career to breaking the silence surrounding this practice in her home country, Jordan. Husseini has suffered abuse and death threats as a result of her courageous work, but in this event she describes how her efforts are slowly beginning to change public perceptions.</event_info>

		<event_info>The New York Times does not dole out hyperbole lightly, so we knew something special must be in store when its reviewer described Karl Marlantes's novel, Matterhorn, as 'one of the most profound and devastating novels ever to come out of Vietnam - or any war.' Marlantes, himself a decorated Vietnam veteran, discusses a book that was thirty years in the writing, and which is set to be one of the literary talking points of the year.</event_info>

		<event_info>The West has tended to portray fanaticism as a deviant form of extreme religious belief. In his new book, Fanaticism, Alberto Toscano offers an intriguing new perspective on the term 'fanatic' and its shifting use in political rhetoric through the ages. While liberals might argue that passion and abstract absolutes (such as universal rights) are the realm of the fanatic, Toscano believes there is a place for such language at the heart of contemporary politics.</event_info>

		<event_info>Two stellar writers, two sons, two fathers. Legend of a Suicide depicts a boy's fraught relationship with his suicidal father, and many of its mysteries appear to be drawn from the real-life voyages of its author, David Vann. With its astonishing layering of different 'truths', Vann's book shows a story turned inside-out, experienced from both sides at once. John Burnside's two recent memoirs tell the haunted, mesmerizing story of his relationship with a difficult, alcoholic father, and its effect on his own personality and addictive behaviour. Chaired by Ruth Padel.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire.

Here, he recalls a troubled time dealing with the obsessive side of his personality which he attempts to douse by going to AA meetings and resolving to 'disappear into the banal'.

		<event_info>In this event we welcome the authors shortlisted for a new literary prize in Russia, the Debut Prize for authors under twenty five. Olga Slavnikova, the prize's director, and Natasha Perova, the publisher of an anthology of the entries, introduce these authors who are young enough to be free of the Soviet legacy and who, in the words of Slavnikova, 'do not resonate to the sort of art that attempts to turn everything Soviet into vintage chic.'</event_info>

		<event_info>The short, short story has become very popular in recent years. Accessible to beginners, a flash fiction can be completed in a coffee break and offers many opportunities for publication. Yet the form is difficult to master and the best examples can be as powerful as any traditional short story. In this workshop with author Gavin Inglis you will read some of the finest works, learn techniques, and write some flash fiction of your own.</event_info>

		<event_info>Each day we pay tribute to persecuted writers from different countries with free readings by Book Festival authors.

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>On 30 August 1930, the last remaining inhabitants of St Kilda were evacuated. No longer able to sustain a viable life on the island, they sadly brought an end to nearly a millennium of continuous human occupation on the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides. In this event the Shetland-based writer and poet Donald S Murray discusses the island and its people with Will Self, who himself once spent a long winter on a remote Orcadian island.</event_info>

		<event_info>Kamchatka, by Marcelo Figueras, is a bestseller across the Spanish-speaking world and it takes place during Argentina's bloody coup of 1976. It tells the story of a ten year old boy who, because of his parents' political beliefs, is forced to run away. Meanwhile, Red April is a Peruvian political thriller by Santiago Roncagliolo, who is widely regarded as one of Latin America's most exciting young writers. Both books offer gripping accounts of the darker sides of Latin America.</event_info>

		<event_info>If there's one person who can tell the story of London's artistic explosion, it is Barry Miles. He ran the Beatles's spoken word label, Zapple, and the Indica Gallery where John Lennon met Yoko Ono, and he has written books on Frank Zappa and William Burroughs. Here he discusses life in London from the heady days of post-war Soho to the early years of YBA.</event_info>

		<event_info>Whether it's EM Forster or Vikram Seth, Salman Rushdie or David Peace, 'the East' has long been a rich source of inspiration for writers whose readers are primarily in 'the West'. In a lively discussion of influences, inspiration and a history of mutual fascination, three writers whose work crosses continents and cultures discuss what it is that drew them to their subjects and what continues to capture the imaginations of readers.</event_info>

		<event_info>Jackie Kay needs no introduction to a Charlotte Square audience, but if one were to be given, it would have to encompass her prolific output as a poet, author, short story writer and playwright. Red Dust Road, her latest book, is an autobiographical journey which bursts from each page with life, generosity and beautiful bravery. Prepare to be entertained and entranced in equal measure.In association with the Scottish Poetry Library</event_info>

		<event_info>Authors Caroline Dunford and Lin Anderson discuss the origins of their ideas and their journey into print. This debate, chaired by author Nicola Morgan, looks at the avenues open to modern authors and considers whether is it easier or harder to get published in the 21st century.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>In his guise as a science fiction writer, Iain M Banks has created a utopian interstellar civilisation known as the Culture. This imaginary community populated by 'transhumans' has real-life parallels in the work of Kevin Warwick, Professor of Cybernetics at Reading University. The subject of Warwick's research is his own body, and he has transformed himself into the world's first Cyborg. In this event Warwick and Banks are joined by Steve Yearley, Director of the ESRC Genomics Policy and Research Forum, to contemplate the future of human beings.</event_info>

		<event_info>Two great Scottish writers: two thrilling page-turners. Alex Gray returns with a crime novel title which might raise some eyebrows: Five Ways to Kill a Man. As DCI Lorimer brings in the New Year, an unpredictable killer is loose in Glasgow. Can Lorimer unmask the serial murderer before someone else pays with their life? Meanwhile GJ Moffat's second thriller Fallout picks up where his debut novel Daisychain left off: a lawyer, a cop, a drugged rock star and a budding Scots film star find themselves in trouble.</event_info>

Murray Watson is having trouble with his latest research project concerning the disappeared young poet Archie Lunan. When Watson flees to the island where Lunan was last seen thirty years previously, this safe haven turns into a cesspit of revelation. Welsh discusses her new novel and her writing for our project of new writing commissions on the theme of Elsewhere.</event_info>

		<event_info>The Observer's former literary editor Robert McCrum has spent four years researching a new language which he claims is sweeping the world. Globish - a simplified version of English containing the 1500 words necessary for international business - is becoming a lingua franca for the world's two billion non-native English speakers. McCrum claims that English + Microsoft = Globish: join him in this event to find out how this linguistic revolution is unfolding.</event_info>

		<event_info>The final event of our Unbound Festival, this celebratory evening brings together authors and musicians for a chance to enjoy the deep links between ideas written, spoken and sung out loud. The line-up for this extraordinary evening will be announced in July, along with the rest of the Unbound programme. All other Unbound events are free (just drop in), but booking is essential for this one, so get your tickets early to avoid disappointment.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>In Skippy Dies, Paul Murray has created a spellbinding book about the death of an Irish teenager that is both hilarious and deeply moving. Across the Atlantic, twenty four year old Saturday Night Live scriptwriter Simon Rich has released his debut novel, Elliot Allagash, the fast-paced comedy about a chubby teenage boy and his ultra-wealthy new friend. Both stories, written for adults, speak about the challenges of growing up in a cynical world.</event_info>

		<event_info>Did the defining moments of the 20th century feel like historic events at the time? The answer is to be found in Robert Fox's new book, We Were There, which brings together eyewitness accounts of key events including The Wall Street Crash, D-Day, Tiananmen Square and 9/11. The eyewitnesses themselves make a fascinating selection: from chance bystanders to Neil Armstrong. Fox's book provides a fascinating overview of the century through the eyes of people who were there.</event_info>

		<event_info>Siegmund Warburg was a German émigré banker who became a dominant figure in the post-war City of London. In his new book, Niall Ferguson, the eminent Glasgow-born historian and Professor of History at Harvard, explores the motivations driving Warburg: what turned this complex and ambivalent man into a leading figure in European integration?</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Football fans know there's a lot more to the game than just the scoreline, and perhaps nowhere could this be truer than in Africa - particularly as 2010 is the year the World Cup finally arrived there. Steve Bloomfield, a former Africa correspondent for the Independent, has written Africa United, charting the build-up to the World Cup and attempting to explain the deep social and political significance of the game to the African people.</event_info>

		<event_info>Task Force Black, by Newsnight's diplomatic editor Mark Urban, paints a vivid new picture of Britain's war in Iraq. It's a book that very nearly couldn't be published and it is a testament to Urban's skills as an investigative journalist that he has persuaded the MOD to allow the story of a secret British-American coalition team to be told. Urban explains how the deployment of Task Force Black against insurgents managed to prevent a disastrous civil war breaking out.</event_info>

		<event_info>With depression cited by the World Health Organization as on a par with heart disease when it comes to damaging our well-being, it's timely that psychoanalyst Darian Leader has gone beyond the common behaviour-focused analyses in The New Black. Subtitled 'Mourning, Melancholia and Depression', the book argues against simply throwing medication at the problem and votes for creativity as one of the means by which sufferers can deal with loss and grief.</event_info>

		<event_info>After the general election, the New Labour project is - at least as Tony Blair envisaged it - finished. So what exactly did twelve years of undiluted New Labour achieve? Polly Toynbee and David Walker, co-authors of two previous books on the subject, return with the definitive assessment of the Blair-Brown years. From gleeful consumerism to economic bust, and from Cool Britannia to Make Poverty History, Toynbee and Walker chart the rise and fall of New Labour.</event_info>

		<event_info>By any measure, art in Glasgow has enjoyed an astonishing period of international success since the 1990s, and Sarah Lowndes's Social Sculpture is the first book to explore the factors which contributed to this. Now, in the light of another Glasgow-based artist winning the Turner Prize, Lowndes discusses the shifting intellectual and social backdrop to the story, with leading Glasgow artist Martin Boyce and the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Adam Szymczyk.</event_info>

The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>'When you are courting a nice girl, an hour seems like a second,' claimed Einstein, explaining relativity. 'But when you sit on a red-hot cinder, a second seems like an hour.' In an age when we live longer yet suffer desperate shortages of time, our relationship with all things temporal is fundamental and may even be at the core of our sanity, argues Eva Hoffman in her intriguing new book, Time.</event_info>

		<event_info>For hundreds of years, landscape has played a leading role in literature from the British Isles. In the new edition of A Writer's Britain, Margaret Drabble's highly-praised appreciation of British writers and their love of landscape, she argues that not only have writers such as Wordsworth, the Brontës, Scott and Orwell been inspired by their experiences of landscape, but that their writing has in turn shaped our relationship to nature.</event_info>

In this event Shriver explains how her novel weaves together powerful polemic with searing intimacy, and yet still manages to remain uplifting.</event_info>

		<event_info>Deforestation in the Amazon; palm oil plantations in Borneo; climate change is often blamed on events elsewhere. Yet Scotland's own history has brought about radical changes to the landscape and our local environment. Peter Wright's Ribbon of Wildness looks at Scotland from the perspective of a walk along its watershed, while Emma Wood's Peatbogs, Plague and Potatoes explores the ecological impact of Scotland's transformation into an industrial nation.</event_info>

		<event_info>The Old Etonian who headed Thatcher's policy unit and edited the Times Literary Supplement has looked long and hard at the 21st century and concluded that through our institutions, entertainments, sexual morality, politics and perhaps even religion, we're partying like it's 499 AD. In Full Circle, Ferdinand Mount delivers a witty and astute analysis of just how much like the ancients we actually are.</event_info>

		<event_info>A true expert on all things China, Michael Dillon has written several books about the contemporary state of the nation. In China: A Modern History, he analyses one aspect which has been largely overlooked: the effects of China's reinvention on the country's ethnic minorities. In Francis Pike's Empires at War, we get an erudite and gripping narrative of how modern Asia developed since 1945 and is shaping today's global political balance.</event_info>

		<event_info>His passion for Georgian buildings runs deep, but passion of a different kind lies at the heart of Dan Cruickshank's new book. The Secret History of Georgian London charts the influence of prostitution on the building of the city, and in this event Cruickshank will compare the development of London with that of Edinburgh's own Georgian building project, the New Town.</event_info>

		<event_info>Awarded the Nisar Osmani Award for Courage in Journalism and dubbed by Christopher Hitchens as 'Pakistan's best and bravest reporter', Ahmed Rashid's work introduced US readers to the Taliban. His most recent book is Descent Into Chaos, a devastating exploration into the 'war on terror' and why the threats to global security are more complex and prevalent than we dared imagine.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival.

		<event_info>In 2000 Joseph Stiglitz, then Chief Economist at the World Bank, was fired after criticising the US Government for its handling of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Now, the Nobel Prize-winning economist believes similar criticisms can be levelled about the global collapse of 2008. In this, a keynote event of the Book Festival, Stiglitz argues that we must create a new global financial architecture based on a better balance between the market and the state, and between means and ends.</event_info>

		<event_info>The discovery of nuclear fission at the end of the 1930s triggered the development of the most powerful weapons of war ever seen. Jim Baggott's Atomic is the first complete history of the race between the US, Germany, Britain and the Soviet Union to build nuclear weapons. He discusses this chilling story and its terrifying impact on both human lives and the outlook of the entire 20th century.</event_info>

		<event_info>You may have seen Philippe Legrain on TV from time to time talking about world trade and migration, and in Aftershock he asks whether globalisation itself is at risk. Warning those proclaiming our economic fortunes to be on the road to recovery not to repeat the mistakes of our recent past, Legrain boldly calls for reform for a fairer, safer, richer and greener world. Come and hear this impassioned thinker.</event_info>

		<event_info>It may have been published on April Fool's Day but the subject of Martin Bell's A Very British Revolution raised few smiles among the British populace. Subtitled 'The Expenses Scandal and How to Save Our Democracy', it focuses on the moment when the public's confidence in their elected representatives plumbed new depths. But could it also be a golden chance to cleanse political life?</event_info>

		<event_info>Scottish identity and our sense of belonging have been widely debated and discussed in recent years, but Andrew Blaikie's new book provides a fresh and intriguing perspective. Blaikie, who is Professor of Historical Sociology at the University of Aberdeen, has studied visual material - and photographs in particular - to explore how we express social identity through imagery. By analysing this material, he describes the 'Scottish social imaginary' - and the impact of modernity upon it.</event_info>

		<event_info>At a time when faith in some of our great institutions such as politics, banking and the church has plummeted, what moral framework should guide our actions? Norman Drummond's new book, The Power of Three, argues that despite the current mood of scepticism, collective life must be driven by core principles: we must put people before process, wisdom before knowledge, and integrity before politics. Join one of Edinburgh's leading spiritual thinkers to explore these key priorities.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

In The Enemy of the Good, Michael Arditti tells the heartfelt story of three landmark years in the life of one extraordinary family in which each person is forced to re-examine their beliefs. Meanwhile Pauline Melville's Eating Air takes a comic view of what happens when former anarchists of the seventies hook up with a group of 21st century Islamic militants.</event_info>

		<event_info>When Nicholas Carr wrote an article for The Atlantic magazine about the effect of the internet on our minds, he sparked a huge and polarised response. Now he has written a full-length book which shows how fully the Web - twenty years old this year - has become enmeshed with our lives. But does it really have profound implications for the way we think, communicate and remember?</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

In turns playful, poignant and deeply political, both writers toy with history and legend, fact and fiction, the private and political, to weave intricate and enticing narratives.</event_info>

		<event_info>Bringing together an impressive array of senior commentators, from a Nobel Prize- winning banker to leading academics, Oliver Chittenden has produced a book which seeks to unzip the problems leading up to the recession. But what makes this project really interesting is its contributors' attempts to map out our options for the future. Join Chittenden and two of the book's contributors to discuss The Future of Money.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

Mandla Langa was an exiled ANC member in the 1970s: today he is regarded as one of South Africa's great literary figures. Marlene van Niekerk is a brilliant and celebrated Afrikaans writer; and Kopano Matlwa recently won the Wole Soyinka Prize for African Literature for her new book, Spilt Milk.</event_info>

		<event_info>One is from the West Indies, the other from Somalia, but both Kei Miller and Nadifa Mohamed have written books whose characters make long journeys to a new life in Britain. In Miller's book, The Last Warner Woman, a young Jamaican woman discovers that her prophetic talents, celebrated in Jamaica, are the object of ridicule when she arrives in England. Mohamed's debut novel, Black Mamba Boy, tells the heart-breaking story of an epic journey through war-torn East Africa to Britain in the 1930s.</event_info>

Lesley Glaister's new novel Chosen, examines how extreme beliefs impact upon individuals and families, as a woman explores the death of her mother and the disappearance of her brother to a religious cult. The debut novel from Swedish writer, Ninni Holmqvist, The Unit, pushes these ideas into the future and a chilling dystopia where you literally sign your life away for the good of society.</event_info>

		<event_info>Rigorous research into Chairman Mao's government has been difficult before now. But a new Communist Party law has opened up thousands of new documents, throwing astonishing light on the disastrous Great Leap Forward programme which descended into the Great Famine. Professor Frank Dikötter has uncovered the awful, shocking extent of the catastrophe that beset China in the early 1960s, when at least forty five million people were worked, starved or beaten to death.</event_info>

This good: catch your breath good', while David Vann's unforgettable fictionalised memoir of his father's death, Legend of a Suicide, justified one critic's claim that 'nothing quite like this book has been written before'. This event offers the chance to meet two writers who have produced riveting, heartbreaking and sometimes shocking accounts of father-son relationships.</event_info>

Not just for its extraordinary wilderness and array of seabirds, but for giving him a chance encounter with a killer whale which changed his life. In Shetland Diaries, Simon King writes of this community, battered by the North Sea but offering a warmth and openness with few parallels.</event_info>

Meanwhile, it is ritual Xhosa circumcisions that concern Thando Mgqolozana in his book A Man Who is Not a Man, which breaks a taboo about the many deaths of young boys in these botched operations.</event_info>

		<event_info>Crime fiction can not only deliver cracking narratives, it can also capture the immediacy of contemporary life. Declan Hughes and Stuart Neville do just that: Hughes with the latest Ed Loy instalment City of Lost Girls, portraying modern day Dublin in the claws of the Celtic Tiger; Neville with Collusion, the follow-up to his gripping debut, the nuances and complexities of post-Agreement Belfast. Both proving how hard it is for people to shake the ghosts of the past whether north or south of the Irish border.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Author of Swung and Ménage, Ewan Morrison has been busy this year collecting stories about people's relationship with and experiences in shopping malls. For Tales from the Mall, Morrison has sewn together anecdotes, myths, jokes and incidents to compile a tapestry of urban living. Simon Crump's Neverland features seventy two standalone yet unifying chapters which present various aspects of Michael Jackson's life. Spookily, the book was completed just four hours before its subject passed away.</event_info>

		<event_info>Renew your love of poetry with a unique approach to reading with Lilias Fraser from the Scottish Poetry Library. In this relaxed discussion you won't need any background knowledge; you'll simply come fresh to the text of single poems, take the time to read deeply, and let new discoveries emerge - without the pressure of reviews, criticism and hype. Poems are provided.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event.

		<event_info>It's Paris 1903 and one of the British Empire's greatest heroes, Sir Hector Macdonald, is about to meet legendary occultist, Aleister Crowley. In The Devil's Paintbrush, Arnott weaves a stirring drama which melds black magic, wild hedonism and revolution. For Baruth's historical thriller, the place and time is London 1763 and James Boswell and Samuel Johnson are stalked through the streets of London by the former's unstable younger sibling.</event_info>

		<event_info>Through Breakfast with Socrates, management consultant Robert Rowland Smith platforms the philosophy of everyday life. From waking up, heading for work, shopping, going to the gym, partying and falling back to sleep, Smith provides a running commentary which draws on the history of ideas. Journalist and former priest Mark Vernon attempts to solve our modern woes by tapping into the mindset of 400 BC with the ambitious Plato's Podcasts.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>When Robert is found dead in a run-down Midlands apartment block, his friend Danny runs away in a panic. What follows is a semi-abstract rendering of a death and its aftermath, and a powerful exploration of life and friendship on the drug-stained fringes of British society. With its fragmentary prose style echoing the writing of William Faulkner, Even the Dogs has propelled Jon McGregor into the literary limelight.</event_info>

		<event_info>Inspiration, to paraphrase Lowell, is an inclination to listen. It's what happens when we fully engage with the world. Award-winning poet John Glenday leads this workshop which looks at ways of stimulating the imagination and beginning the process of translating second thoughts into first drafts. Glenday's most recent collection, Grain, is a Poetry Book Society Recommendation and was shortlisted for both the Ted Hughes Award and the Griffin Poetry Prize.</event_info>

		<event_info>Mary Contini is a leading member of the celebrated food dynasty behind Edinburgh institutions such as the famous delicatessen Valvona &amp; Crolla. This year she has assembled a book of 200 Italian recipes and sprinkled it with personal anecdote and history, and we are thrilled that Contini will discuss some of these in Charlotte Square Gardens.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>When Anna Politikovskaya was assassinated in October 2006, writers from around the world vowed that this courageous campaigner for human rights should not have died in vain. The Book Festival aims to remember Politkovskaya's work every year, and for 2010 we welcome Arch Tait, who has translated the journalist's key books, Nothing But the Truth and Putin's Russia, into English. Alongside him, Masha Karp, a London-based journalist who works with the BBC's Russian Service, will speak about Politkovskaya's ideas.</event_info>

Finding Poland is the result. In Chinese Whispers, Jan Wong also takes a trip to her past by examining the Maoist zeal she felt as a youth while trying to track down a woman she reported to the authorities during her period of study at Beijing University.</event_info>

		<event_info>Scotland's pre-eminent historian Professor Tom Devine has provided a vibrant fresh perspective on Scottish life in the modern era. Devine, having published some thirty books, was most recently the editor of Scotland and the Union 1707-2007 but for this lecture he turns to the years preceding the Union. He contends that far from being darkness before the dawn, the foundations of 18th century transformation were rooted in the decades before 1707.</event_info>

		<event_info>Since Peter Irvine's Scotland the Best was first published in 1993, the internet has transformed the world of printed travel guides. Yet Scotland the Best has remained a remarkable success, with regular new editions ensuring a cult following. Meanwhile series such as Cool Camping and Wild Swimming, published by Jonathan Knight's company Punk Publishing, have found an enthusiastic niche. Knight and Irvine discuss their work with Paul Murton, who is preparing a TV series about the remarkable history of the travel guide.</event_info>

		<event_info>The Jenny Colgan brand shows no sign of waning and with The Good, The Bad and The Dumped she looks to have another hit on her hands. The book asks a perennial question: what would you do if you've let Mr Right escape your grasp? Let him go, assuming that what's for you won't go past you? Or get onto Facebook right this minute and track him hungrily down?</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>In two very different stories, set in radically different cultures, Jonathan Lee and Christy Lefteri have created characters whose stories cross borders in a quest to find someone and resolve a mystery. Lee's Who Is Mr Satoshi takes its protagonist from London to Tokyo, while Lefteri's A Watermelon, A Fish and a Bible moves from Cyprus to London and back in search of a lost love. Each book heralds a bright new voice in British fiction.</event_info>

Responding to a challenge laid down by MacCaig before his death, Greig setsout for the north-west of Scotland to fish for trout in a remote loch that MacCaig countedas his favourite.

		<event_info>Remainder, Tom McCarthy's first book, was described by Zadie Smith as 'one of the great English novels of the last ten years'. In his new novel, C, McCarthy's hero embarks on a strange, Pynchonesque journey across the 20th century, from a Bohemian spa and the First World War, to a climax in an Egyptian catacomb. A brave new voice in literary fiction, McCarthy joins us in Edinburgh to launch his book.</event_info>

		<event_info>Short stories are enjoying an astonishing resurgence and there are few British writers approaching the form with more panache than Michèle Roberts and Helen Simpson. Roberts's collection, Mud, is built around intense explorations of women's grief, love and betrayal while Simpson's In-flight Entertainment describes a series of lives in transit. Both collections amount to sharply drawn, engaging portraits of Britain today.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

Similarly, Philip Ó Ceallaigh's second short story collection The Pleasant Light of Day confirms him as a potent new voice in Irish fiction.</event_info>

		<event_info>Most of Lydia Davis's short stories are only three or four pages long; some stretch to one paragraph, or even just one sentence. Whatever their length, these spare and highly charged fragments of prose are bittersweet, dramatic, meticulous and often very funny accounts of existential angst. It is an enormous pleasure to welcome Davis to the 2010 Book Festival.</event_info>

		<event_info>While the classic nature-versus-nurture debate over the source of human intelligence has long been eclipsed by the understanding that it's a mixture of both, advances in the study of neurology have tended to focus scientific research on the genetic side of the equation. But David Shenk's new work on the very strong environmental influences on intelligence has given a new energy to the debate. Shenk is joined in this event by Wendy Johnson, an expert in the interaction of genes and environment.</event_info>

		<event_info>There can be no meaningful peace in Afghanistan unless the US and British governments develop a working relationship with the Taliban. That's the conclusion of Edinburgh-based writer James Fergusson in his new book, Taliban. Equally forthright is Jim Frederick, the Time reporter whose new book on Iraq, Black Hearts, is a stark but ultimately even-handed account of some of the US army's darkest moments in the war.</event_info>

As the siblings come to terms with their conflicting emotions, old tensions and turbulences rise to the surface. Maggie Gee's My Animal Life is an evocative portrait of family life in a post-war England infused with sex, death and duty.</event_info>

		<event_info>According to Robin Dunbar, Oxford Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology, the human brain is only capable of managing a maximum of 150 friendships. Tell that to the Facebook generation which seems hell-bent on amassing ten times that number. In How Many Friends Does One Person Need?, Dunbar probes this theory further as well as asking questions such as: why do men talk and women gossip? Why is monogamy a drain on the brain?</event_info>

In the mid-1990s she spent seven months as writer-in-residence in Antarctica and made several journeys to the Arctic for her latest book, The Magnetic North. She begins with the 5000 mile stretch of the Russian Arctic before moving on to Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Lapland and in each place she encounters the problems and possibilities of a disappearing world and a changing climate.</event_info>

		<event_info>These two novelists are bestsellers in their respective countries, and this year their writing should set British readers alight. Najat El-Hachmi's story, The Last Patriarch, won the prestigious Ramon Llull prize in her home of Catalonia. It tells the story of a family in the midst of an east-west culture clash. Meanwhile Elif Shafak is the most widely read author in Turkey, and her new book, The Forty Rules of Love, is a mesmerizing and inspiring story about finding love.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>There are many different ways in which writers' freedom to express oneself can be inhibited by different political systems. In this event, two leading writers discuss suffering as well as everyday life in the country they identify closely with. Aminatta Forna's father was an opposition politician assassinated in Sierra Leone, while Wendy Law-Yone's father was the founder of the leading daily the Rangoon Nation in Burma. Here, they discuss the vital power of the 'free word'.</event_info>

		<event_info>Best known for his radical reinventions of crime fiction, Christopher Brookmyre has most recently been stirring up two altogether different genres: science fiction and horror. Pandaemonium, described by Patrick Ness as 'smart, funny, big-hearted and blood-spattered,' brings a group of school children into a head-on collision with pointy-horned demons from another world. Always a favourite with audiences, Brookmyre returns to discuss his book.</event_info>

		<event_info>As if there wasn't enough drama in life already, this brand-new series from author and comedienne Louise Rennison takes the mantra literally by enrolling a group of girlfriends in drama school. Showbiz (where is it?), boys (where are they?) and theatre dahhhhhhling. Theatre. And no parents (did you hear that?). Fans of Georgia Nicholson will be queuing for tickets to meet Louise and her wild new gang.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

Twitter averages 50 million tweets a day. With this much information and this many people, are we emotionally and personally connected, or just sharing information?

		<event_info>Underneath the trillions and the billions, the banks and the bail-outs, is hidden the impact of the financial crisis on our own lives. In The Hopeless Life of Charlie Summers and The Financial Lives of the Poets, Paul Torday and Jess Walter, from opposite sides of the Atlantic, have written tales that capture the destruction, desperation and absurdity of life when thrown into crisis, when all that you know and believe is torn away, leaving you clutching what you love.</event_info>

		<event_info>Would you turn to an economist for help with your relationship problems, the art of parenting or for advising on the benefits of flossing? Thousands do, as readers of the Financial Times know - and now the highlights of Tim Harford's hilarious column, 'Dear Undercover Economist', have been brought together in a book. A hugely engaging speaker, only Harford could credibly turn love affairs into a question of supply and demand.</event_info>

		<event_info>As if cycling all the way round the world were not incredible enough, Mark Beaumont achieved it so quickly that he smashed the previous world record for the 18,000-mile trip by a staggering eighty one days. But Beaumont did not simply get himself into the record books: he became a different person in the process, gaining a unique insight into people from many different cultures. Come and ask him about his remarkable journey.</event_info>

		<event_info>We used to think of the Arctic as an isolated, empty and pristine land in a peripheral location. Not any longer. As the world is increasingly defined in relation to climate change, energy resources and changing trade patterns, the Arctic is moving right into the centre of our minds. Charles Emmerson, formerly associate director of the World Economic Forum, has written the definitive book on the region today. Join him to discuss The Future History of the Arctic.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>'Political autobiographies are, with occasional exceptions, dross,' argues Roy Hattersley. Too often, he claims, they are 'badly written perversions of history punctuated with intentional errors and cynical omissions.' In this address the former Shadow Chancellor and deputy leader of the Labour Party makes an impassioned critique of political memoirs, examining a precious few examples which have achieved greatness.</event_info>

		<event_info>As part of a documentary series for BBC Four, Owen Sheers travelled across Britain from Dover to Orkney to explore six unforgettable landscape poems. In a new book Sheers expands upon the theme, bringing together a collection of poems by writers from Keats and Wordsworth to Alice Oswald and Jen Hadfield. In doing so, he demonstrates that poems about landscape are also poems about ourselves.</event_info>

		<event_info>Throughout the 1960s, television viewers tuned into Dr Finlay's Casebook, the drama set in 1920s Scotland in the fictional town of Tannochbrae. The series, based on the stories by A J Cronin, was revived in 1993 with David Rintoul playing Dr Finlay. Now, to celebrate the re-edition of Cronin's short stories that inspired the television series, Rintoul returns to Edinburgh to read passages from the book, and to speak about one of his best loved roles in a distinguished television and acting career. Joining him in discussion is author Alan Davies, who has written a moving biography of A J Cronin.</event_info>

		<event_info>When they first fell in love, Harold Pinter described his affair with Antonia Fraser as 'joyous, dangerous, unavoidable.' The affair blossomed into a celebrated literary marriage, lasting from 1975 until Pinter's death in 2008. Drawing from her own diaries, Fraser has written a poignant memoir about the couple's relationship, and in this event she shares stories with Ian Rankin, a long-standing friend of both Pinter and Fraser.</event_info>

		<event_info>Brooklyn is the beautiful and moving story of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish woman who seeks her fortune in New York and is then forced to return to Ireland where she faces a heartbreaking dilemma. Colm Tóibín, one of Europe's most accomplished living authors, discusses his astonishingly insightful account of the sequence of choices that make up one woman's life.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>'I am not a man. I am a hat stand,' says Chris Killen's hero Will in The Bird Room, as he stands naked in a bedroom with a woman's hat hanging on his erection. So begins the tale of a man who meets Alice, falls in love, and then finds himself in a hall of mirrors in which characters mutate and multiply. Killen is one of Britain's leading young writers, while John Wray is being similarly applauded in the USA. Granta magazine named him as one of its Best of Young American Novelists: Lowboy is his story of an odyssey beneath New York.</event_info>

		<event_info>Drawing on hundreds of confidential conversations, the Observer's Chief Political Commentator Andrew Rawnsley has written the story of a political epoch. With its claims about Gordon Brown's ferocious temper, Rawnsley's book has sparked furious debate in the press but, now, as the dust settles on the General Election and a new political landscape emerges, Rawnsley looks back at the age of New Labour.</event_info>

		<event_info>The West has tended to portray anarchists as a dangerous spectre looming over liberal European life. In The World That Never Was, Alex Butterworth offers an intriguing new perspective, painting a striking picture of the revolutionaries, spies and agents provocateurs who made up the international anarchist movement of the late 19th century. His book throws new light on the circumstances surrounding the great wars of the early 20th century.</event_info>

		<event_info>Few British writers have achieved greater public notoriety than Will Self in recent years - and few notorious writers have managed to sustain such critical acclaim. Self's mordant satire is at the peak of its form in a new triptych, Walking to Hollywood, a potent mixture of memoir and invention which centres around his passion for wandering on foot around cities. Eventually Self decides to take a walk on British land which is about to be consumed by the sea.</event_info>

		<event_info>Once Britain's 'Most Admired CEO' with a stellar career at the helm of BP, John Browne's reputation as a visionary leader collided with a perjurious attempt to conceal a gay relationship, and thereafter followed his abrupt resignation. In his searingly honest memoir, Lord Browne describes his reinvention and how he re-established his reputation as a brilliant business leader.</event_info>

		<event_info>Two novelists from different backgrounds have created visions of the near future at opposite ends of the world. Olga Slavnikova's 2017 won the Russian Booker Prize for its depiction of the country 100 years after the Soviet revolution, while James Miller's Sunshine State is an apocalyptic thriller set in a post-holocaust Florida. This intriguing event considers how the things we are doing today might impact on our future.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Writing that is defined as 'fantasy' or 'sci-fi' is too often dismissed in literary circles but it can be where some of the most stylistically challenging and innovatively creative work is being done. The near-futures created by the best exponents of the craft, whether utopias or dystopias, are often the best critiques of our contemporary society, challenging our assumptions and questioning our collective future. Adam Roberts, author of New Model Army, and Ken MacLeod, author The Restoration Game, discuss with Stuart Kelly their work and its role within literary fiction and culture.</event_info>

Each one, whatever its length, captures a complete universe in spare but succulent prose which was recently described by Rick Moody as 'the best in America'. The publication of The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis represents the culmination of a lifetime's writing, and Stuart Kelly welcomes a giant of US fiction to Edinburgh to discuss her work.</event_info>

		<event_info>The Times has described Tariq Ramadan as one of the most important innovators of the 21st century, but the Swiss-born academic's writings on Islamic theology have made him a lightning rod for controversy. He has been accused of defending the stoning of adulterers, while others have attacked his 'fascism', and 'anti-semitism'. Ramadan passionately denies these charges and has written a book, What I Believe, in which he sets the record straight.</event_info>

		<event_info>Vita Sackville-West described her family as 'a rotten lot, and nearly all stark staring mad', and for thirteen generations the family lived in a grand family house in Knole, Kent. When Vita was unable to inherit the estate after their father's death, she bought nearby Sissinghurst instead.

The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>An exclusive tutored whisky session with Highland Park, a loyal supporter of Scottish literature and the Edinburgh International Book Festival in particular. Each tasting takes you through the distiller's award-winning single malts from Orkney. The combination of traditional whisky-making techniques with obsessive attention to detail have made Highland Park arguably the most respected single malt in the world. And for the first time this year, the event takes place in the atmospheric surroundings of the Highland Park Spiegeltent, making it doubly special.</event_info>

		<event_info>Former volunteer aid worker Sharyn Lock visited the Gaza Strip in 2009 as part of the Free Gaza Movement. Shortly after her arrival, Israel launched a relentless assault on Gaza, unleashing what Amnesty International described as 'twenty two days of death and destruction'. Gaza: Beneath the Bombs, written together with Sarah Irving, is an eyewitness account giving insight to horrors the mainstream media was unable to offer.</event_info>

		<event_info>Plato considered it a form of indigestion, while by the 17th century it was thought of as melancholia: whatever the cause, hypochondria has long been the scourge of writers and creative people. Brian Dillon discusses the hypochondriac states of great thinkers of the modern era, including fascinating new perspectives on Charlotte Brontë and Marcel Proust.</event_info>

		<event_info>From Waverley station to the vast monument in his memory, Walter Scott's influence on Edinburgh is evident. But a new book by Stuart Kelly suggests much more - that Scott was nothing less than the architect of everything we now associate with Scottish national identity. In this debate, our panel, led by Kelly, discusses the extent of Scott's influence.</event_info>

		<event_info>When Boris Johnson ousted Sir Ian Blair in a political coup in 2007, the Metropolitan Police Chief's turbulent career came to an abrupt halt. That turbulence had reached its peak in 2005, when London endured tragic deadly terrorist bombings and, only a few weeks later, the accidental shooting by Met officers of an innocent man, Jean Charles de Menezes. And yet during this period Blair can also claim to have achieved some notable successes. Hear Blair's own version of events in this session.</event_info>

		<event_info>First published in 2000, Inside The Wicker Man became something of a cult - just like the film it discusses. In a new edition, it shows that despite a disastrous filming process, the film retains an enduring fascination for critics and fans alike. Allan Brown will be joined by two actors who appeared in the film and who will discuss the latest on the long-awaited sequel, The Wicker Tree.</event_info>

		<event_info>After his explosive book Kitchen Confidential was published, Anthony Bourdain's life went 'into meltdown'. That book, a warts-and-all look behind the scenes at New York's restaurants, turned Bourdain into a celebrity when it was published in 2000, but its success also contributed to the failure of his marriage. In his eagerly-awaited new book, Medium Raw, Bourdain explains what happened next, with razor-sharp observation.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar.

		<event_info>He is Professor of History at Exeter University and the author of over eighty books: little wonder that Jeremy Black is regarded as one of the world's leading voices on politics and international relations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Black's latest book, The Battle of Waterloo, not only offers a fascinating reinterpretation of the war itself, but also an overview of its importance in the shifting tectonic plates of international power at the beginning of the 1800s.</event_info>

		<event_info>Vidal Sassoon's life has gone from an impoverished childhood in East London to household name status. But those who connect him solely with modernist hair care might be surprised to learn that he battled the fascists in Britain and fought in the army of the fledgling state of Israel. His memoir, Vidal, is set to be an autumn highlight and this event will be one of August's most anticipated.</event_info>

		<event_info>In this event, two contemporary writers share vastly different perspectives on one of the greatest English writers of the 20th century. Jeremy Lewis describes the small town roots of Graham Greene's family, and the pioneering dynasty that grew up there. Tim Butcher discusses his extraordinary voyage to Sierra Leone and Liberia - the same route trekked by Greene in 1935 and immortalized in his travel classic Journey Without Maps.</event_info>

		<event_info>'Leaving the Labour Party was like pulling my own teeth, one by one,' says Shirley Williams, the MP once seen as a contender to become Britain's first female Prime Minister. The political upheavals of an era in which Margaret Thatcher dominated, and Williams co-founded the Social Democrat Party, are at the heart of an autobiography which is at once insightful and endearing.</event_info>

		<event_info>The acclaimed biographer Lyndall Gordon looks at the life and work of 19th century poet Emily Dickinson in Lives Like Loaded Guns and uncovers a writer of great intellectual strength. Although Dickinson only published seven poems in her lifetime, she wrote more than 1,700. Gordon examines these alongside her family life to draw some intriguing new conclusions.</event_info>

		<event_info>Few books can claim to offer a genuinely new perspective on the Second World War, but Michael Burleigh's Moral Combat is one. Focusing on the on-the-spot decisions that leaders had to make, Burleigh analyses the moral reasoning by Hitler, Mussolini, Churchill and others, under circumstances difficult to imagine. In this event, he discusses his remarkable, original approach.</event_info>

		<event_info>Developments in the internet and electronic publishing are revolutionising the way books are sold and read. Not since Gutenberg has there been such a profound change in the transfer of knowledge in our society. What effect is this having on authors? If the physical book dies out, how will this alter the nature of fictional and non-fictional texts? With the fragmentation of the reading constituency, how will classics be identified and reputations made? A panel of distinguished novelists, critics and editors will discuss these issues with special reference to their own practice as writers.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Last year, Candia McWilliam arrived to deliver her event with newly-restored sight after an operation had brought an end to a two year period of blindness. The condition which had brought about her blindness came on top of many years of writer's block, but during these sightless days McWilliam found she had rediscovered her voice. This year we are honoured to welcome her back to present her first book in over a decade.</event_info>

		<event_info>A decade ago, Alan Warner's The Sopranos introduced a group of fearless Scottish teenage girls to the world and watched them run riot. Now, in The Stars in the Bright Sky, the gang are in their early twenties and they're planning a reunion. With holiday bags packed, the young women must decide which ultra-cheap flight they'll take for a fortnight of debauchery in the sun. Warner discusses his new book and his involvement in our commissioned writing project, for which he has created a story on the theme of Elsewhere.</event_info>

		<event_info>Born John Wardle in East London in 1958, Mr Wobble helped form Public Image Limited and collaborated with the likes of Sinéad O'Connor, Björk and Baaba Maal. But the highs of a career in bass-playing also featured the lows of marital breakdown and chronic alcoholism. Memoirs of a Geezer is an unexpurgated portrayal of music, mayhem and life.</event_info>

Now, as Alistair Darling comes to terms with life as a backbencher again, the Edinburgh South West MP can reflect on a distinguished ministerial career. In this lecture he talks about three eventful years in Number 11 Downing Street as well as discussing Scotland's role in post-devolution Britain, and his personal views on Britain's economic prospects.</event_info>

		<event_info>Lovetown, Michal Witkowski's debut, is the first Polish novel to portray gay life under a communist state. It tells the story of Patricia and Lucretia, typical pre-Solidarity 'queens', nostalgic about the old days of secrecy and shame. They present a stark contrast to the new out-and-proud gay generation who have 'ruined' the Baltic seaside resort of Lovetown. Five years after it took Poland by storm, Witkowski's book is finally published in English.</event_info>

		<event_info>His most recent collection of poems, Full Volume, was published in 2008 and then The Bard, his biography of Robert Burns, won last year's Saltire Society Scottish Book of the Year: it has been a highly productive period for Robert Crawford. In this event, the Professor of Modern Scottish Literature at St Andrews looks at the role of the poet as a tradition bearer through the lens of his recent books.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>When Steve Bell decided to invite US cartoonist Garry Trudeau, author of the legendary Doonesbury cartoon, to speak with him in Edinburgh, little did he know that the world's fragile recovery from recession would be thrown into doubt by financial chaos in Europe, and by clouds of volcanic ash. Add this to the predictably uncertain political situation in Britain and you have perfect material for a discussion between two of the world's greatest cartoonists.</event_info>

		<event_info>Battles over religion and rationality have tended to suggest that science and religion are mutually exclusive. Richard Swinburne's latest books seek to prove that Christianity's central beliefs stand up to philosophical scrutiny. Meanwhile Piers Moore Ede's travels have taken him around the world, in search of spirituality as it is understood in Himalayan villages, on the banks of the Ganges and in rural Turkey.</event_info>

		<event_info>At ninety years old, Alistair Urquhart is the last surviving member of the Gordon Highlanders, the Scottish regiment captured in Singapore by the Japanese in the Second World War. While most of his close comrades perished, Urquhart got to the other end of working on the notorious River Kwai Bridge, and was finally forced down a mine in Nagasaki, close to the spot a nuclear bomb was dropped two months later. The Forgotten Highlander tells a traumatic and inspiring life story.</event_info>

		<event_info>Following The Apple Ghost and Undark, John Glenday's long-awaited Grain represents a distillation of fourteen years' devotion to his craft. Its distinctive voice - lyrical, keen-eyed, rejoicing and contemplative - has been rapturously received and garnered him the attention longstanding readers will know is deserved. Newcomers to his work can expect a rare treat.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>In spite of the recent recession, capitalism remains the world's dominant economic system, but in this event two leading economists argue that our economy faces radical change. How is the West going to compete with China, and will countries choose the Chinese model of capitalism rather than the Western model? Chang, a political economist at Cambrige University and Kaletsky, editor-at-large of The Times, offer some challenging conclusions.</event_info>

		<event_info>The editor of the London Review of Books has quite a family history. Though they were Russian fur traders at the time of the Soviet revolution, one great-uncle was also involved in acts of Stalinist terror - including arranging the murder of Leon Trotsky. Another was a friend of Sigmund Freud and he may also have been a Soviet agent. In her fascinating memoir, Wilmers tries to throw light on some dark corners of 20th century history.</event_info>

		<event_info>John Julius Norwich is the author of books on Norman Sicily, the republic of Venice and the Byzantine Empire, but his latest work is a true labour of love. For The Great Cities in History, he set the likes of Bettany Hughes and Simon Schama the task of writing with passion and authority about the art and character of places such as Amsterdam, Constantinople, Edinburgh and Athens. A breathless and awe-inspiring journey ensues.</event_info>

		<event_info>The Royal Stuarts were at the centre of some of the greatest political dramas in British history. For more than 300 years they ruled over Scotland and for a century were the Royal Family of Britain, with Mary Queen of Scots, Charles I and Bonnie Prince Charlie among the many players in an astonishing family saga. Renowned Scottish author Allan Massie presents a new and intriguing history of this singular dynasty.</event_info>

		<event_info>A generation after Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch, the feminist movement seemed to have reached a curious impasse. 'Is Feminism Dead?' screamed the cover of Time magazine in 1998 over a photograph of Ally McBeal. In fact, not nearly enough has changed, according to Natasha Walter, author of Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism, and Kat Banyard, author of The Equality Illusion: women make up only 12% of FTSE100 directors, and they earn 22% less per hour than men.</event_info>

		<event_info>The work of Robert Adam, one of Scotland's greatest architects, is readily visible in Charlotte Square, the north side being a typically elegant example of his neoclassical 'Adam style'. In a brand new biography, Roderick Graham recounts the story of a man whose style was influenced by a move to Italy and a friendship with Piranesi, but whose thirst for social status led him to seek his fortune in London.</event_info>

		<event_info>It is a shocking fact that 100,000 British children run away from home each year. Rachel Billington's The Missing Boy imagines the story of a teenager estranged from his artistic parents, who escapes to the countryside only to find himself in the company of people who want to exploit him. Billington, a former president of PEN, discusses the subject with sensitivity and compassion.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Widely regarded as one of Britain's leading right-wing thinkers, Roger Scruton proposes in his new book that great harm has been wrought on the world by optimists and idealists. At a time of political scandal and religious fundamentalism, Scruton argues that now more than ever we should rely on humane pessimism - and that this is the root of reason and responsibility.</event_info>

		<event_info>When Fatima Bhutto's father was murdered by Pakistani police in 1996, Benazir Bhutto - her aunt - was Prime Minister. Fatima became a passionate critic, claiming that Benazir had ordered her father's murder. A decade later, Benazir herself was assassinated. Now, in Songs of Blood and Sword, Fatima Bhutto reveals the tragic history of a political dynasty whose fate mirrors the tumultuous events of Pakistan itself since its independence in 1947.</event_info>

		<event_info>In 1852 a teenager named Theresa met and fell in love with an Irish aristocrat in a chance encounter. Convinced they were destined for one another, Theresa pursued William until he agreed to a common law marriage in Scotland. Yet less than a year later William had married another woman. Chloë Schama tells the story of a singular woman, and how her battle to reform marriage law made her both victim and celebrity.</event_info>

		<event_info>He may have grown up in Glasgow, but Martin Creed's artistic career went into orbit in London when he won the 2001 Turner Prize for his Work No 227, the Lights Going On and Off. Creed's work is highly visible in Edinburgh in 2010 when he presents both a major art exhibition and a ballet. Alongside them, two new books provide a powerful overview of nearly twenty years of artistic endeavour.</event_info>

You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Two brilliant writers have located their short stories in the love - and loathing - at the heart of family life. Patrick Gale, author of the recent bestselling Notes From an Exhibition, returns with Gentleman's Relish, while Ruth Thomas looks at the fragility and folly of kinfolk in her new collection, Super Girl.  A culinary son; a bored wife; a disobedient puppy: these beguiling collections weave a path through a very extended family.</event_info>

All the more powerful then, that such a senior figure should use the word 'torture' to describe the US treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Join Sands in Charlotte Square Gardens to learn why he believes the policy of abuse originated with Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and George W Bush.</event_info>

		<event_info>According to Mary Mellor, money should not be simply a device for getting rich but a democratic resource structured on a 'sustainability' basis. In The Future of Money she argues that the state is central to the stability of the money system and that it is time to rescue it from its capitalist 'hijacking'. Meanwhile Andrew Simms has co-authored Bad Company, a radical analysis of the rise and fall of the Great British Corporation.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire.

		<event_info>The success of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall has brought a welcome boost to historical fiction this year, and readers who enjoyed Mantel's book will find much to enjoy in these two gifted Scottish authors. Shona MacLean's second book, A Game of Sorrows, charts a series of mysterious events in 17th century Aberdeen, while Shirley McKay's Hue &amp; Cry is a story of passion, betrayal and corruption in 16th century St Andrews.</event_info>

		<event_info>Although their books are set two thousand years apart, there is a fascinating parallel between the work of British writer Stephanie Merritt (writing as S J Parris) and Canadian author Annabel Lyon. Parris's book, Heresy, spins around the true story of a progressive scientist whose views in the late 16th century were regarded as heretical. Lyon's novel, The Golden Mean, tells the story of the great philosopher Aristotle and his search for contentment.</event_info>

		<event_info>Artie Cohen, the detective at the heart of Reggie Nadelson's stories, is the kind of man whose history has been so well sketched out, it's impossible not to believe in him: the fine detail of Artie's flawed character is every bit as impressive as the gripping plots of each book. In this event Nadelson discusses Artie's latest assignment - tackling Russian criminals in London - with Edinburgh's own favourite crime writer, Ian Rankin.</event_info>

Join them both to hear about their mould-breaking work.</event_info>

Hickman's tale of love and greed, The Pindar Diamond, moves from Venetian courtesans of the early 17th century to the coasts of Dalmatia, while Lovric's The Book of Human Skin takes place 200 years later, and leads its protagonists to colonial Peru.</event_info>

		<event_info>The debut novel by star Guardian features writer Laura Barton is Twenty-One Locks, the fresh, honest story of a young woman who must choose between what she wants and what everyone expects. Meanwhile, Beauty establishes its author Raphael Selbourne as a bright new star of British fiction. It tells the story of a young Bengali woman living in Wolverhampton who, fleeing from an arranged marriage, finds help from a white working class ex-offender.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire.

		<event_info>With a big heart and an eye for an unforgettable story, Louis de Bernières is always a Book Festival favourite. Ever since Captain Corelli's Mandolin, de Bernières's talent has been widely recognised - through sales figures and literary prizes alike. Here is a writer whose warm-hearted prose can make the heart soar and then bring it crashing brutally down to earth again, and he does just this in his newest book, a collection of stories set in the Surrey village where he grew up.</event_info>

		<event_info>The world is witnessing the greatest population shift in history. Across the planet, from Mexico City to Shanghai, cities are growing at breakneck speed. Doug Saunders is an award-winning Canadian journalist who, in his fascinating book Arrival City, visits the places where population shift is having the biggest impact: not the city centres we know, but on the margins, in places we barely notice. These, he argues, are 'arrival cities', and we'd better learn how to look after them.</event_info>

You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Nobel Prize-winners don't come more outspoken than economist Joseph Stiglitz, whose book Freefall considers how we should respond to the global economic meltdown. Stiglitz argues that the fiscal deficits incurred during the crash of 2008 were underpinned by a moral deficit which will require action by us all. Should we continue to allow materialism to provide the defining framework for our lives, and what are the alternatives?</event_info>

		<event_info>The Hand That First Held Mine is Maggie O'Farrell's account of motherhood from the perspective of two women separated in space and time, and the result is her best novel yet. 'Motherhood is often depicted as this caring, nurturing thing...but it also has this amazingly tigerish, fierce side,' says O'Farrell. In this event the author discusses these raw and rarely-discussed emotions.</event_info>

This led to a London childhood of being protected by Scotland Yard and constantly checking under the family car for bombs.</event_info>

		<event_info>All his life, East Lothian-born Martin Davidson has known that his grandfather had Nazi connections, but after fifty years of secrecy and guilt he decided to research the family archives and find out the truth. His discovery, that his ancestor was a loyal SS officer and almost certainly involved in the Krystallnacht brutalities against the Jews, led Davidson to question how ordinary people became seduced by Hitler's ideology. He discusses the traumatic story in this event with Kirsty Wark.</event_info>

In The Music Instinct, he aims to reveal what happens to us when we hear rhythms, melodies and harmonies that we like and seeks to help us understand sounds we might not immediately appreciate. Ultimately, Ball hopes that the 'music expert' within us all can be unleashed.</event_info>

		<event_info>Britain's intervention in Iraq has been widely and fiercely criticised, yet despite this we remain heavily committed to foreign military activities across the globe. What better time then, for former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and his co-writer Edward Young to tell us about Choose Your Weapons, a highly engaging history of British foreign policy which speaks volumes about the challenges facing our nation today.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire.

		<event_info>According to economist and Financial Times columnist John Kay, sometimes our goals are best pursued indirectly. Kay, whose latest book is called Obliquity, believes that complex problems can best be solved using tangential approaches. With fans like Mervyn King and Nassim Taleb, Kay's counterintuitive approach has some influential backing. Join him in this event to hear why direct approaches are often unimaginative and arrogant.</event_info>

		<event_info>Chris Mullin was a Labour MP for over twenty years and in his humorous and incisive memoirs, A View from the Foothills, he documented the challenges facing a politician trying to stick to his principles. On the back of this success, his political satire of the 1980's A Very British Coup has been reissued. Described as 'the political novel of the decade', the story of the power struggle between Downing Street, Whitehall, Fleet Street and Washington has striking resonances with the past thirteen years of government.</event_info>

		<event_info>From 1934 to 1978, Hugh MacDiarmid and Sorley MacLean entered into regular correspondence about culture, politics and history as well as musing upon the mundane challenges of modern living. A lecturer in English at Canada's University of Victoria, Susan Wilson brings us the first complete, annotated edition of correspondence between these icons of Scots poetry. She also charts their developments as writers and analyses the influence each had on the other's career.</event_info>

		<event_info>Michel Faber once stated that 'the more the writer tries to force the reader to regard something as amazing and special, the more suspicious and bored the reader will become.' Perhaps that explains the deadpan manner in which, in a story commissioned by the Book Festival, a woman walks into a police station and says: 'I was abducted by aliens. Abduction is a crime.' Join the acclaimed author of The Crimson Petal and the White to hear how 'elsewhere' can be hilariously ordinary.</event_info>

		<event_info>In the 1950s, with its post-war economy in full swing, there was a short time in the Soviet Union when communists believed the system would deliver a fabulous bounty that capitalism could not match. Francis Spufford's Red Plenty discusses the people who tried to make this dream come true, while Rachel Polonsky surveys the literary riches of the era through the eyes of Stalin's henchman, Vyacheslav Molotov.</event_info>

		<event_info>Hot on the heels of her bestselling Chalcot Crescent, Fay Weldon returns with Kehua!, bringing her trademark tongue-in-cheek perspective on suburban London to Muswell Hill. Here, a young New Zealand woman has fled to escape a past involving a murder and a suicide. But she brings with her the kehua - Maori ghosts of the dead New Zealanders - who have followed her across the world.</event_info>

		<event_info>The only way of keeping a grasp on politics and economics is by turning them into stories. A brief conversation becomes 'Bigotgate' and transforms a politician's life into a Shakespearean tragedy; a high-flying banker becomes 'Fred the Shred' - a pantomime villain. Big business knows that those who control the story will be the winners. In this event, leading author Charlie Fletcher brings together a political journalist, a businessman and a cultural commentator to look at Story in the context of the communications explosion.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Whatever the cause of climate change, its effects are going to be felt by everyone. With sea levels rising and food yields plummeting, populations shifting and economies crashing, the world stands on the brink of an apocalyptic era. Gwynne Dyer, a leading journalist whose columns are published in forty five countries, discusses his book Climate Wars, painting a stark picture of the world in the not-so-distant future.</event_info>

		<event_info>For every great invention, there is the equal possibility for that invention to be misapplied. That is the thesis of Robert Winston, professor of science and society at Imperial College, and he has plenty of evidence to back it up. Relativity gave us nuclear weapons as well as nuclear energy; antibiotics can kill just as easily as they can cure; and genetics raises the spectre of cloning and eugenics. Join Lord Winston for a fascinating discussion of the ethics of innovation.</event_info>

		<event_info>99% of British teenage boys have played one, and they easily outweigh the impact of films: for any of us who doubted it, Tom Chatfield's new book shows just how influential video games are set to be. But the influence goes beyond pure economics: as Chatfield explains in this discussion, games could become a key area for intellectual advancements. Chaired by Pat Kane.</event_info>

		<event_info>In one of the finest literary biographies of 2010, Lyndall Gordon has captured new insights into the life and work of the poet Emily Dickinson. Lives Like Loaded Guns describes the explosive secret liaison which not only dictated the battle for 'ownership' of Dickinson's legacy but also quietly tore her family apart. In this event, Gordon talks to the poet Ruth Padel, biographer and great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin, and descendent of John and Willam Hunter.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>Education Consultants Steve Bell and Sallie Harkness introduce you to the Storyline method of teaching for primary schools, originally developed in Glasgow and now used the world over. This dynamic approach encourages students to become independent learners: the teacher designs the line (the chapters of the story) and the learners create and develop the story. Not only about knowledge and skills, Storyline also focuses on feelings and attitudes; come along for a thoroughly enlightening experience.</event_info>

		<event_info>American author, journalist and lecturer David Shenk explains the theory behind his bestselling new book The Genius in All of Us. This witty and compelling speaker shrugs off outdated concepts of genetic 'giftedness' and inborn intelligence, and proves that talent is not a thing but a process. Come and hear his deeply optimistic message of how we can tap into latent reserves of talent and ultimately flourish. An essential event for parents and anyone interested in education.</event_info>

		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event.

But do the experiences of India's megacities offer any pointers to the future of European cities, or vice versa? In this event, we welcome Suketu Mehta, a New York-based journalist and author of the novel Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found. Opposite him is Sam Miller, a long-time BBC correspondent in Delhi, and author. Chaired by Stephen Cairns.</event_info>

		<event_info>Goldman Sachs has predicted that China's economic output will overtake that of the USA by 2027, and some have even suggested that we are on the threshold of a new era in human history. Will the 21st century be 'the Asian century', or can we expect a future of multipolar world power? And how will China's growing wealth affect the rest of the world? Debating these questions are authors Jonathan Watts and Richard McGregor, chaired by Allan Little.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event.

		<event_info>Ever since 1776, the USA has been driven by an ideal expressed in its Declaration of Independence: 'Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' But after a generation of fabulous wealth and inestimable power, the American Dream seems to be losing its gloss. Can Barack Obama restore his citizens' confidence and rediscover a positive role for the USA in global affairs? Join our panel, including Guardian journalist Gary Younge and author David Vann to debate the issues. Chaired by Allan Little.</event_info>

		<event_info>The cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars goes far beyond the $155 billion spent each year by the US and British armies, and with Western voter opposition to the wars at an all time high there is increasing pressure for troops to be withdrawn. But will there be a further cost in human lives after the troops have gone, and can anyone see a route to lasting peace? In a debate chaired by Allan Little, foreign correspondent James Fergusson and journalist Ahmed Rashid consider an answer.</event_info>

		<event_info>Our television screens portray a Middle East racked by conflict and oppression, and nowhere more so than in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Is this focus on violence giving us a distorted impression of the ordinary people who live there? Gabriella Ambrosio's book, Before We Say Goodbye, co-published in the UK by Amnesty International, tells the story of a friendship that arises in the hours before a suicide bomb attack, and she leads this discussion chaired by Allan Little.</event_info>

		<event_info>A generation which does not read; a culture in which authors and scholarship cannot survive; potential bestsellers unidentifiable in a deluge of dross. Is this the end or is it the start of a new direction for books and writers? Michael Schmidt, founder of Carcanet Press and Professor of Poetry at Glasgow University; author Tom Holland and Kate Pool of the Society of Authors discuss the burning topics facing authors and readers in the 21st century. Chaired by Angus Konstam.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere.

		<event_info>Britain is changing fast, and even though it may not be known as 'progressive', the new coalition government in Westminster has pledged to rebuild what David Cameron has described as 'broken Britain'. But with swingeing public sector spending cuts in the offing, and the fledgling coalition between right and centre left remaining open to sabotage from within, what should the Tory and Liberal partnership realistically be seeking to achieve? Join four leading thinkers to look at the options.</event_info>

		<event_info>Recession and stress may have taken their toll on our bank balances, and it appears that the coming years will certainly not be paved with gold. But does the new age of austerity give us a chance to work less and enjoy life more? If so, how should we go about it? Join our panel, including authors Barry Miles and Tom Chatfield, to debate the issues. Chaired by Ruth Wishart.</event_info>
		<venue_info>There is much to enjoy during a visit to the Book Festival, it's not only about the events! The festival's home, the beautiful leafy Charlotte Square Gardens (at the west end of George Street, a minute away from Princes Street), is a wonderful space in which to sit, talk, think, play and be entertained. You can see a favourite author, join in a workshop or debate, enjoy a cuppa in the café, a beer in the Highland Park Spiegeltent, or simply park yourself on the grass (with or without a book) and soak up the atmosphere. We run two independent bookshops in Charlotte Square Gardens - one for adults and one especially for children. They stock thousands of titles by visiting authors plus a wide array of contemporary literature, with all proceeds going directly back into the Book Festival. There are plenty of refreshments on site with our three cafés offering a variety of fairtrade hot and cold drinks, light snacks, yummy cakes and ice-cream plus a fully-licensed bar. Remember, entry to the Gardens is FREE and EVERYONE is welcome! Fully wheelchair accessible site and free wheelchair hire. Please pull in at the west end of George Street to drop off wheelchair users. A selection of British Sign Language interpreted events. Infrared systems in all theatres to assist people with auditory impairments. Please collect a set of earphones from the Information Desk in the Entrance Tent prior to your event. Guide dogs and hearing dogs are welcome.</venue_info>

		<event_info>For the last three decades, the rich have been getting richer but not necessarily happier. Meanwhile, by financial standards, 'wealth inequality' has never been greater. Is it time for a 'new moral order'? Authors Katharine Hibbert and John Lanchester debate the issues in this plenary session which brings together conclusions from five days of vigorous Book Festival debate.</event_info>

		<event_info>The world has passed an historic tipping point now that more than half its population lives in cities. Such a rapid migration is creating new economies, new conflicts and new types of space. Leading Canadian foreign affairs writer Doug Saunders and award-winning Danish architect Bjarke Ingels debate their entertaining and strikingly different analyses of the global city and its future. Chaired by Stuart Gulliver.</event_info>
