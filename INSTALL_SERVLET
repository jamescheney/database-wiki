Installation instructions:

Unix/MacOS command line:

Need: 
  * subversion command line tools
  * javac/JDK (Java 1.6)
  * tomcat
  * ant
  * postgreSQL (>= 8.4)
  * Firefox web browser

1.  Check out sources:

  svn checkout https://database-wiki.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ondrej database-wiki

2.  Create a PostgreSQL user and database owned by that user (e.g. 
dbwiki).  Give the user a password.  Make sure the server is 
running and the password is correct efore proceeding.

3.  Create config and initial user list files:

  cd resources/configuration/server
  cp config.sample config
  cp users.sample users

Edit config so that JDBC_USER is the username (e.g. dbwiki) and 
JDBC_PASSWORD is that user's password.  If the PostgreSQL server 
you want to use is remote, then change JDBC_URL to point to the 
appropriate host.

4.  Change back to the root of the source tree and initialize the
 database:

  cd ../../..
  sh create-server.sh

This should produce no output on success.  You can confirm this by 
checking that three tables have been added to the dbwiki database.

5.  Build and deploy the project:

  ant build-war
  cp dist/DatabaseWiki.war <tomcat>/webapps
	
6.	Configure tomcat to make DatabaseWiki the root application
	Add the following line under <Host> to conf/server.xml in the tomcat folder

  <Context path="" docBase="DatabaseWiki" debug="0" reloadable="true"></Context>

7.  Test that the server is running correctly by visiting

  http://localhost:8080

using Firefox (other web browsers may work but have sometimes 
had incompatibilities).

8.  Load some data.  One way to do this is by clicking "New" on the server home page, and entering the following values:

Short Name: TEST
Name: Test

...

URL: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/test.xml

Leave the other fields blank/default values.  Click "Save".

Currently, the system will read xml from a URL and infer a schema for it, 
and after clicking Save the schema will be filled in.  You can change it, 
but there is no reason to: just click Save again, and a database will 
be created.
