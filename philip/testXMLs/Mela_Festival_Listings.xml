		<event_info>Edinburgh Mela / Iron Oxide Ltd in Co - production. A risk-taking, water-soaked exploration of the universal need to migrate. This daring large-scale outdoor production weaves together extreme physicality, a stunning soundtrack, intricate imagery and strange yet familiar characters. In a world of dangers, high seas and troubled lands, CARGO tells the tale of two people and their quest for the perfect place to call home. Filled with adventurers, exiles, conquerors and slaves, CARGO explores the primal urge of humans to leave their country of origin, whether it be for a better life, to escape a past, for a new way of living, or to find... themselves.</event_info>

		<event_info>A lavish depiction of the story behind the creation of the Taj Mahal, the woman who inspired it and the two men who loved her. Accompanied by live, specially commissioned music from the Sabri Ensemble. Filmed entirely on location in India with a cast of thousands, this remarkable product of early Indian cinema went on to inspire a generation of film makers by its combination of documentary techniques and epic subject matter. Shiraz is one of an extraordinary trilogy films by German director Franz Osten working in collaboration with Indian actor and producer Himansu Rai. This groundbreaking East &amp; West partnership is echoed in the dynamic, cross-cultural score by Sarvar Sabri. Sabri leads the Sabri ensemble in an exploration of melodic and rhythmic influences drawn from South Asian, Latin American, jazz and Western classical traditions. The line up of tabla, sarangi, violin, piano, vocals, bass, sitar, saxophone and flute combine to create a rich soundscape that seamlessly complements the original film, despite an eighty-year gap in their conception.</event_info>

Parking in the surrounding area is very limited and will be strictly controlled by parking and traffic control measures, including vehicle uplift for illegally parked vehicles. Due to this, and to make the festival as environmentally friendly as possible, we strongly advise that you use public transport to travel to the festival. If you need to travel by car for part of the journey please consider the use of one of Edinburgh's many Park and Ride facilities.
