Database Wiki
=============

Entry points
============

The entry points are defined as main methods of classes in
org.dbwiki.main:

  CreateServer
  DatabaseImport
  DropDatabaseWiki
  DropServer
  ImportPresentationFiles
  StartServer
  
For convenience, various wrapper scripts are included in the root
directory for invoking the various entry points with appropriate
classpaths using configuration files in
./resources/configuration/. Those ending with a .sh suffix are
suitable for UNIX platforms (including Linux and Mac OS X).  Those
ending with a .cmd suffix are suitable for Windows.

Initialising a server
---------------------

Java class:

  CreateServer <config-file> <user-listing>

Scripts:

  create-server.sh
  create-server.cmd

This creates the following tables in the relational database:

  wiki_config_files
  wiki_server_database
  wiki_server_user
  
The first argument is a server configuration file.  The second
argument is a user configuration file.

Example files are currently in:

  ./resources/configuration/server/config.sample
  ./resources/configuration/server/users.sample

We recommend copying these into 

  ./resources/configuration/server/config
  ./resources/configuration/server/users

and editing according to your local configuration, then the script can
be used.

Starting a server
-----------------

Java class:

  StartServer <config-file> 

Scripts:

  start-server.sh
  start-server.cmd
  
You should now be able to access your Database Wiki server through
your web browser by going to:

  http://localhost:8080/

Importing XML data into a new database wiki
-------------------------------------------

Java class:

  DatabaseImport <config-file> <name> <title> <xml-file> <user>

Scripts:

  database-import.sh  <name> <title> <xml-file> <user>
  database-import.cmd <name> <title> <xml-file> <user>

The <name> is a short name for the database.

The <title> is a descriptive name for the database.

The <user> is the name of the user to use to record the import.

Importing presentation data
---------------------------

Java class:

  ImportPresentationFiles <config-file> <db-name> <path> <user>

Script:

  import-presentation-files.sh  <db-name> <path> <user>
  import-presentation-files.cmd <db-name> <path> <user>

The <path> is the path to the presentation files. The files should be named:

  <path> + <db-name> + ".css"
  <path> + <db-name> + ".layout"
  <path> + <db-name> + ".template"

Dropping a database wiki
------------------------

Java class:

 DropDatabaseWiki <config-file>

Scripts:

  drop-database.sh
  drop-database.cmd
  
You will be asked which database wiki you wish to drop. All data
associated with that database wiki will be deleted.

Dropping a server
-----------------

Java class:

  DropWikiServer <config-file>
  
Scripts:

  drop-wiki-server.sh
  drop-wiki-server.cmd

You will be asked whether you also wish to drop all the database wikis.
All of the tables created by CreateServer will be deleted. If you
answer yes to the question, then the all the database wiki data will
also be deleted.
