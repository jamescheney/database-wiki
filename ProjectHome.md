A wiki lets users collaborate on Web content easily through a Web browser, and wikis also make it easier to understand the process by which some data was created by recording detailed history records.  A Database Wiki is a wiki for structured data, providing both database-like capabilities to structure and query data and wiki-like capabilities for collaboration and transparency.
